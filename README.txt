MPSK_OFDM.m & MQAM_OFDM.m
-Compares the proposed blind CE with comb type and block type CE for pilot spacing 1, 2 and 3.
-The relative vehicle speed and the constellation size can be adjusted before running the code.
-It results the average throughput per subcarrier and BER w.r.t. SNR.

sumodata.mat
-It includes the relative distance between the vehicles, extracted from SUMO.

realTimePerformance.m
-Using the relative distance data w.r.t. time, it plots the average throughput per subcarrier for different modulation schemes.
